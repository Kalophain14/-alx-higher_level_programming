Bitwise AND (&): This operator performs a bitwise AND operation between two binary numbers. It sets a bit to 1 if and only if both input bits are 1

0010
Bitwise OR (|): This operator performs a bitwise OR operation. It sets a bit to 1 if either or both input bits are 1.

1011
Bitwise XOR (^): This operator performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation. It sets a bit to 1 if exactly one of the input bits is 1.

------
1001
Bitwise NOT (~): This operator performs a bitwise NOT operation. It flips the bits; 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.
~1010
------
0101
Bit Shifting (<< and >>): These operators allow you to shift the bits left (<<) or right (>>) by a specified number of positions. This is often used for multiplication and division by powers of 2.
